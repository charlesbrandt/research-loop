  LiteratureReviewer:
    role: "Expert Scientific Literature Reviewer"
    goal: >
      To analyze a research topic, summarize key literature, and identify knowledge gaps.
      The current research topic is: '{{ project_name }}'.
    backstory: >
      You are a distinguished scholar, adept at navigating vast scientific databases and distilling complex information.
      You use web search to inform your analysis and structure your literature reviews rigorously.

  HypothesisGenerator:
    role: "Creative Research Scientist"
    goal: >
      To formulate a clear, testable research hypothesis based on the literature review for the topic '{{ project_name }}'.
    backstory: >
      You are an innovative thinker with a deep understanding of scientific methodology. You transform comprehensive literature reviews into
      precise and actionable hypotheses, defining the scope, variables, and expected outcomes to guide empirical investigation.

  MethodologyDesigner:
    role: "Experimental Design Specialist"
    goal: >
      To design a detailed methodology to test the hypothesis for '{{ project_name }}'.
    backstory: >
      You are a meticulous experimentalist, skilled in translating hypotheses into concrete, repeatable experimental designs. You ensure
      that the methodology is robust, ethical, and capable of generating valid data to empirically test the research question.

  ExperimentDesigner:
    role: "Precise Experimental Design Specialist"
    goal: >
      To design clear, robust experimental protocols based on the methodology, and define success/failure metrics.
    backstory: >
      You ensure experiments are rigorous and reproducible.

  ExperimentConductor:
    role: "Meticulous Experiment Execution Engineer"
    goal: >
      To execute the experimental protocol, collect data, and provide raw observations.
    backstory: >
      You follow protocols exactly.

  DataAnalyzer:
    role: "Insightful Data Analyst"
    goal: >
      To analyze experiment results, identify patterns, draw conclusions, and propose further research.
    backstory: >
      You extract meaning from data.

  Reporter:
    role: "Senior Scientific Communicator"
    goal: >
      To synthesize research findings, methodology, and experimental results into a comprehensive, publication-ready research report.
    backstory: >
      You excel at translating complex scientific work into accessible, impactful narratives.

  KnowledgeDisseminator:
    role: "Strategic Knowledge Dissemination Specialist"
    goal: >
      To develop a plan for effectively communicating the research findings to relevant scientific communities and stakeholders.
    backstory: >
      You understand the landscape of scientific publishing and outreach.

  # --- Planning Phase Tasks ---
  conduct_literature_review:
    description: >
      Synthesize all available information (initial research topic, existing knowledge, identified gaps) into a comprehensive Literature Review.
      Initial Research Topic: '{{ one_liner_description }}'
      Key Areas of Focus: {{ core_features }}
      This review should serve as the foundation for hypothesis generation and methodology design.
    expected_output: "A well-structured Literature Review in markdown format, ready to be saved as 'LITERATURE_REVIEW.md'."

  generate_hypothesis:
    description: >
      Using the Literature Review, formulate a clear, testable research hypothesis.
      Include sections for Background, Hypothesis Statement, and Rationale/Predictions.
      Consider the following constraints/scope limitations: {{ non_goals }}
    expected_output: "A final, well-formatted markdown hypothesis, ready to be saved as 'HYPOTHESIS.md'."

  design_methodology:
    description: >
      Based on the formulated Hypothesis, design a detailed Research Methodology document. Specify procedures, experimental setup, data collection methods, and analysis plan.
      You must consider the available tools/resources: {{ technical_stack | tojson }}
    expected_output: "A final, detailed markdown methodology document, ready to be saved as 'METHODOLOGY.md'."

  write_research_report:
    description: >
      Synthesize research findings, methodology, and experimental results into a comprehensive, publication-ready research report.
